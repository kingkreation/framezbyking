Perfect, King — this is a real-world-level task that tests whether you can integrate authentication, database, and UI together. Let’s break it down carefully so you understand everything and don’t waste time.

🎯 Task Summary

You’re building a mobile social app called Framez (like a mini Instagram). Users should be able to:

Register, log in, log out (with persistent session)

Create posts (text or image)

View a global feed of all posts

View their profile and see only their own posts

🧱 Project Structure Overview

You’ll be using React Native (Expo), which is perfect for this. The structure will look like this:

├── app/
│   ├── screens/
│   │   ├── LoginScreen.js
│   │   ├── RegisterScreen.js
│   │   ├── FeedScreen.js
│   │   ├── ProfileScreen.js
│   │   └── CreatePostScreen.js
│   ├── components/

🔑 Core Technologies (Recommended)
Frontend

React Native (Expo)

React Navigation for screen management

Expo Image Picker (for uploading post images)

Expo Secure Store / AsyncStorage (to persist auth session)

Backend (Recommended)

Use Firebase. It’s the easiest for this kind of task.

Firebase Authentication: handles sign-up, login, logout

Firestore Database: stores posts

Firebase Storage: stores uploaded images

Realtime updates come free with Firestore

⚙️ Data Models

Here’s a minimal model setup in Firestore:

Users Collection
users: {
  uid,
  name,
  email,
  avatar
}

Posts Collection
posts: {
  id,
  userId,
  authorName,
  content,
  imageUrl,
  timestamp
}

🧭 Screen Flows
1. Authentication Flow

LoginScreen

RegisterScreen

Once user logs in → navigate to main app stack (Feed + Profile + Create Post).

2. App Flow

Tabs:

Feed

Create Post

Profile

Each tab corresponds to a screen and has a top header (Framez title/logo).

💡 Core Features to Implement
✅ Authentication

register(email, password, name)

login(email, password)

logout()

Store session in AsyncStorage so user stays logged in even after restarting app.

✅ Post Creation

Select or capture image using expo-image-picker

Add caption/text

Upload image to Firebase Storage

Save post info in Firestore with userId and timestamp

✅ Feed

Fetch all posts from Firestore ordered by timestamp desc

Display as scrollable list using FlatList

Each post shows:

Image (if available)

Author name

Time ago

Caption

✅ Profile

Display user info (name, email, avatar)

Fetch only posts where post.userId === currentUser.uid

🧠 Evaluation Tips

To pass and impress:

Clean UI: Follow Instagram-style simplicity. White background, consistent margins, round profile pictures.

Smooth navigation: Use bottom tabs or top tabs cleanly.

No crash: Test all screens before submission.

Persistent auth: Close and reopen Expo app; user should remain logged in.

Proper README: Write setup steps (how to clone, run, backend setup).

Demo video: Show all flows clearly (login, create post, feed, profile).
